# Recurrent-Neural-Networks
# Step 1. Business Understanding
# a) Specifying the Research Question
Build a recurrent neural networks model that will be used to predict Tesla stock prices in 2017 using data from 2012-2016

# b) Defining the Metric for Success
Build a neural networks regression model with an RSME less than 10% of the target mean.

# c) Understanding the Context
Stockpy is an innovative fintech enabling financial prosperity for the entire population. It is a venture funded startup based in Palo Alto bringing world-class financial experiences to a continually growing customer base. As Stockpy enters an expansion phase for innovative fintech product offerings, it aims to enhance the enormous value in data processing and analysis for continuous growth and success.

As a Finance Data Scientist for Stockpy, you provide leadership to turn cutting-edge technology into actionable insights; unlocking the power of data that provides value to business decisions and customer service enhancements.

# d) Recording the Experimental Design
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Preparation
4. Data Modeling and Evaluation
5. Summary of Findings and Recommendation
6. Challenging the Solution

# Step 2. Summary of Findings and Recommendation
The RMSE of 147 indicates that the model is not reliable in predicting stock prices. A lower values of RMSE would have indicated a better fit, we will need to train the model further to improve on its accuracy

# Step 3. Challenging our Solution
a) Did we have the right question?
yes, the question could be solved by modelling

b) Did we have the right data?
Yes. However we need more training data

c) What can be done to improve the solution?
The following steps can be used to improve our model's performance:

1. Getting more training data
2. Increasing the timesteps
3. Adding some other indicators
4. Adding more LSTM layers
5. Adding more neurons in the LSTM layers
